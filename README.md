# Mosquito and Drones
### Problem statement
###### These days number of diseases caused by mosquitoes are rapidly increasing.
###### Here are some statistics for the same :-
- 2015 : 60,000 cases registered  
- 2016 : 1,30,000 cases registered
- 2017 : 1,70,000 cases registered
###### This calls for innovative and feasible solution to eradicate the threat from mosquitos. 
#### Idea Proposed
###### The solution for this problem statement can be done as follows:
- Detection of potential breeding grounds.
- Eradicating the breeding grounds.
###### Modern day computer vision and DL techniques and algorithms can be exploited to optimistically detect and eradicate mosquitoes larvae.
